# Navet Feature Map

This document is a current implementation map for Navet's major product areas. It is intended to
help contributors understand where behavior lives, which sections are active, and where story/test
coverage is expected to exist.

## Feature Inventory

Current active feature folders under
[`src/app/features/`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/features):

- `auth`
- `calendar`
- `climate`
- `dashboard`
- `energy`
- `lighting`
- `media`
- `notifications`
- `person`
- `rss`
- `scenes`
- `security`
- `sensors`
- `settings`
- `tasks`
- `vacuum`
- `weather`

Additional notes:

- `power/` exists as a folder in the tree but is not currently an active feature entrypoint
- cross-feature imports should prefer a feature's root `index.ts` when that entrypoint exists
- `notifications` is a supporting feature surfaced through shared app-shell UI rather than a top-level section

## App Shell

### Root app composition

[`src/app/App.tsx`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/App.tsx) assembles:

- the i18n provider
- the global error display
- the authenticated split between login and dashboard shell
- the PWA update prompt
- the network status surface
- the notification/toast layer
- theme- and viewport-related DOM synchronization

Shared app-shell composition lives primarily under
[`src/app/components/layout/`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/components/layout).

Current layout ownership includes:

- header and sidebar
- room navigation
- section navigation helpers
- section customization shell/button
- mobile command, search, and section sheets
- reusable section layouts such as locks, media, and security

## State and Data Flow

### Shared state

Navet uses Zustand for all shared reactive state.

Current store files:

- `auth-store.ts`
- `config-store.ts`
- `edit-mode-store.ts`
- `error-store.ts`
- `home-assistant-store.ts`
- `navigation-store.ts`
- `search-store.ts`
- `settings-store.ts`
- `theme-store.ts`

Shared selectors live in
[`src/app/stores/selectors.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/stores/selectors.ts)
and should be preferred over full-store subscriptions.

### Home Assistant flow

[`src/app/services/home-assistant.service.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/services/home-assistant.service.ts)
is the public Home Assistant facade. It composes:

- [`src/app/services/ha-connection.service.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/services/ha-connection.service.ts)
- [`src/app/services/ha-entity-service.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/services/ha-entity-service.ts)
- [`src/app/services/ha-registry.service.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/services/ha-registry.service.ts)

The facade emits typed updates for:

- entities
- config
- registries
- connection

The store updates only the affected slices for each event. Avoid broad "copy the whole service
state" sync patterns.

Navigation keeps `currentRoom` persisted in the store while `activeSection` is derived from the URL
through [`src/app/navigation/sections.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/navigation/sections.ts).

## Top-Level Sections

The current primary section model is:

- `home`
- `energy`
- `security`
- `tasks`
- `locks`
- `lights`
- `media`
- `settings`

Section routing and lazy loading are coordinated by
[`src/app/features/dashboard/components/dashboard-section-router.tsx`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/features/dashboard/components/dashboard-section-router.tsx).

### Section ownership

- `home`: room-driven dashboard overview, editable zone-based home canvas, and home widgets
- `energy`: energy dashboard, setup wizard, drilldown flow, and energy-only custom widget band
- `security`: camera-first section built on the shared device-section shell
- `tasks`: Home Assistant automation/task summaries grouped into sections
- `locks`: lock-focused section built on the shared device-section shell
- `lights`: all-lights overview using the dashboard all-view grid in custom grouping mode
- `media`: grouped media section with audio and TV-specific presentation
- `settings`: appearance, localization, dashboard, interaction, project, and system settings

## Dashboard

### Ownership

The dashboard feature owns:

- card registration
- entity visibility
- custom-card placement
- room ordering
- card ordering
- dashboard-specific persisted layout state
- sectioned and flow layout behavior

Important paths:

- [`src/app/features/dashboard/utils/card-renderer.tsx`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/features/dashboard/utils/card-renderer.tsx)
- [`src/app/features/dashboard/hooks/`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/features/dashboard/hooks)
- [`src/app/features/dashboard/stores/custom-cards-store.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/features/dashboard/stores/custom-cards-store.ts)
- [`src/app/features/dashboard/stores/dashboard-entities-store.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/features/dashboard/stores/dashboard-entities-store.ts)

### Current custom widgets

Current `CardType` values for dashboard/section widgets:

- `rss`
- `photo`
- `note`
- `battery`
- `energy-now`
- `button`
- `map`

Home-widget implementations currently live under
[`src/app/features/dashboard/components/widgets/`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/features/dashboard/components/widgets).

The widget store also uses special room sentinels:

- `__home__` for widgets attached to the home overview
- `__energy__` for widgets attached to the energy section band

Home widgets may additionally persist zone overrides via
[`src/app/features/dashboard/zones/`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/features/dashboard/zones).

### Room sourcing

Home-room navigation is assembled from two sources:

- Home Assistant areas via [`src/app/hooks/use-area-rooms.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/hooks/use-area-rooms.ts)
- discovered device rooms via [`src/app/hooks/use-devices.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/hooks/use-devices.ts)

This keeps the room list stable when registry-backed area names exist while still surfacing devices
whose room can only be inferred from entity metadata.

### Home overview zones

The `All` home view is grouped into four named zones:

- `hero`
- `actions`
- `status`
- `analytics`

Default placement and fallback resolution live in:

- [`src/app/features/dashboard/zones/zone-types.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/features/dashboard/zones/zone-types.ts)
- [`src/app/features/dashboard/zones/resolve-card-zone.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/features/dashboard/zones/resolve-card-zone.ts)
- [`src/app/features/dashboard/zones/use-zone-layout.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/features/dashboard/zones/use-zone-layout.ts)

- `shared/`: app-specific shared UI and compatibility shims
- `layout/`: app-shell and section-level composition
- `ui/`: wrappers around library primitives and dropdown/dialog infrastructure

See [../README.md](../README.md) and [README.md](README.md) for the higher-level explanation.

### Storybook support

Storybook is the review surface for:

- token and theme stories
- shared primitives and patterns
- layout and navigation surfaces
- entity cards
- dashboard widgets
- settings sections
- energy-specific visuals

Shared story helpers live in
[`src/app/storybook/story-frames.tsx`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/storybook/story-frames.tsx)
and
[`src/app/storybook/story-docs.ts`](/Users/vishal/Development/Github/Navet/Navet/src/app/storybook/story-docs.ts).

## Testing Map

Vitest is the preferred path for:

- shared utility logic
- persisted store behavior
- controller composition
- browser-dependent hooks
- token and entity-mapping helpers
- dashboard actions and feature-specific logic seams

## Maintenance Expectations

- Update this file when top-level sections, feature ownership, widget types, or test locations change
- Remove references to deleted feature folders or moved paths instead of leaving historical hints in active docs
- Prefer describing the actual current tree over describing an intended future architecture
